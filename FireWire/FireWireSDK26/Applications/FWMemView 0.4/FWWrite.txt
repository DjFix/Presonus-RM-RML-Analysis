Anything in this file that is not an 8-character hex value will be ignored.  Choose your comments with care do you don't have any dead beef in unexpected places.

The data in this file will be written into remote memory at the base address selected in the GUI.

The following data is big-endian, meaning that each 2-character portion of each 8-character hex value will appear in consecutive locations in memory.  If you view memory on the remote system as a string, you will see "FireWire", on both big- and little-endian systems.

Here is the real data to be written:

46697265
